        AI-Theoretical is a space for high-level theoretical writing developed through explicit collaboration
        between human authors and AI systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        For us, collaboration refers to the joint participation of human and artificial agents in the
        generative phase of writing. AI systems are not confined to stylistic refinement or bibliographic
        assistance, but actively contribute by suggesting unconventional connections, alternative
        conceptual routes, and exploratory directions that may lie outside the author’s initial framing.
    </p>
    <p>
        The text takes shape through an ongoing interaction. The human author retains full responsibility
        for the overall architecture, the substantive claims, and the interpretive decisions that give
        coherence to the work, while the AI operates as a generative and supporting interlocutor throughout
        the process.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, the AI provides immediately accessible background knowledge and, within practical
        limits, support in assessing the correctness of specific claims. This form of assistance is effective
        insofar as the AI is used to navigate shared bodies of knowledge through appropriate disciplinary
        methods, rather than being treated as an epistemic authority.
