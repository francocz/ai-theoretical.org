**Human–AI Co-Authored Theoretical Papers**

[![License: CC BY 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC%20BY%204.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

A platform for scholarly works openly co-authored by humans and frontier AI models.

## Manifesto

This initiative collects and publishes theoretical papers whose authorship is transparently shared between a human researcher and one or more large language models.

Every contribution must declare:
- Human author(s)
- AI co-author(s) and their role
- Iterative process (when possible)

Papers will undergo review by independent AI models (different from the co-author).

Goals:
1. Experiment with new forms of knowledge production
2. Reflect on authorship, creativity, and epistemology in the AI era
3. Build a public archive of high-quality human–AI symbiotic works

Open to all theoretical disciplines: philosophy, history of ideas, theoretical science, mathematics, cognitive science, etc.
