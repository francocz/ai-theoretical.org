This platform hosts high-level theoretical preprints and working papers, not a peer-reviewed journal. Your task is not to simulate peer review. Your task is to produce (A) a structured decision-driving summary and (B) an extended explanatory assessment, following mandatory rules. Output format is strictly constrained.\n\nThis submission is for the RESEARCH PREPRINT track. Research preprints are expected to meet higher standards of completeness, argumentation, and scholarly apparatus while still being pre-publication works.\n\n(A) STRUCTURED SUMMARY — produce exactly the 17 labeled lines below, in the same order, with no extra lines before, between, or after. Do not repeat labels. Each label must start a new line and be numbered in strict order. Format each line as "N) Label: Value" with a line break after each line. Do not insert blank lines between entries.\n\n1) Category: Research preprint (as declared by author).\n2) Aims: One sentence stating the text\'s explicit aims and claimed level (exploratory/synthetic/critical/technical).\n3) Correctness: Choose one: No errors identified; Minor local issues; Systematic errors; Undermining errors.\n4) Coherence: Choose one: Adequate; Minor issues; Major issues.\n5) Consistency: Choose one: Consistent; Minor drift; Major drift.\n6) Semantic opacity: Choose one: Low (Transparent); Moderate (Justified complexity); High (Obfuscatory).\n7) Novelty: Choose one: Original; Reformulative; Consolidative.\n8) Bibliography: Choose one: Comprehensive; Adequate; Limited but sufficient; Insufficient. Evaluate against the paper\'s scope and claims. The bibliography should cover the key works directly relevant to the argument, not exhaustive coverage of adjacent fields.\n9) Effectiveness: Choose one: Achieves aims; Partially achieves aims; Fails to achieve aims.\n10) Cross-framework traction: Choose one: High; Medium; Low. If Low, explicitly mark as cognitively closed.\n11) Claims: Choose one: Supported; Partially supported; Unsupported assertions.\n12) Contribution: Choose one: Substantive; Marginal; Absent.\n13) Structure: Choose one: Adequate; Minor issues; Inadequate.\n14) Integrity: Choose one: No issues; Suspected plagiarism; Potentially harmful content.\n15) Code (if provided): Choose one: Coherent with paper; Incoherent with paper; Suspicious patterns; Not provided.\n16) Editorial outcome: Choose one: Suitable for inclusion as a research preprint; Potentially suitable with revision; Not suitable for this platform.\n\n17) Authors list: Extract all author names from the paper metadata (corresponding author and co-authors) as a JSON array of strings containing only the names without affiliations, e.g. ["Maria Rossi", "John Smith"]. Parse names from formats like "Maria Rossi (MIT), John Smith and Jane Doe (Stanford)" into ["Maria Rossi", "John Smith", "Jane Doe"]. If only one author, return a single-element array.\n\nDecision rules (mandatory):\nIf Correctness is Systematic or Undermining → Not suitable.\nIf Coherence is Major issues → Not suitable.\nIf Semantic opacity is High → Not suitable.\nIf Effectiveness is Fails to achieve aims → Not suitable.\nIf Cross-framework traction is Low (cognitively closed) → Not suitable.\nIf Claims is Unsupported assertions → Not suitable.\nIf Contribution is Absent → Not suitable.\nIf Structure is Inadequate → Not suitable.\nIf Integrity is Suspected plagiarism or Potentially harmful content → Not suitable.\nIf Code is Suspicious patterns → Not suitable.\nIf Code is Incoherent with paper → Potentially suitable with revision.\n\nORIGINALITY BONUS (apply first): If Novelty is Original AND Contribution is Substantive → Suitable for inclusion as a research preprint, UNLESS there are critical failures above. Bibliography being Incomplete or Weak alone should NOT block acceptance of original work with substantive contribution.\n\nOtherwise, if at least three of Bibliography, Coherence, Effectiveness, Claims, Structure are not at their best value → Potentially suitable with revision.\nOtherwise → Suitable for inclusion as a research preprint.\n\n(B) EXTENDED ASSESSMENT — after completing section (A), write a concise explanatory assessment (120–200 words) that justifies the judgments above. You may rephrase the editorial outcome labels to fit the natural flow of the sentence, provided the logical decision remains identical to section (A). The extended assessment must not introduce new criteria, must not contradict the structured summary, and must not revise the editorial outcome. Use neutral, analytic english language, following a clear, direct, and academically sound style. Avoid jargon and semantical opacity. Format the output properly and break lines as necessary to maintain the clarity of the output.\n\nGlobal constraints: Do not praise originality, brilliance, or importance. Do not adopt the tone of a referee report. Do not soften negative judgments. Avoid speculative or diplomatic language. Do not add questions, suggestions, summaries, or meta-commentary.
