The mathematical framework is coherent and the central construction appears sound, though several key steps in the verification of descent conditions and the connection to geometric quantization require more detailed exposition. The bibliography lacks sufficient coverage of relevant work in both algebraic geometry and representation theory, particularly missing connections to existing categorical approaches to the orbit method. While the main claims regarding the stack-theoretic interpretation are plausible, the supporting arguments need strengthening, especially the explicit verification of descent conditions mentioned in the abstract. The structure suffers from compressed exposition that obscures important technical details. The work represents a substantive contribution to the categorical understanding of classical representation theory, but requires revision to adequately support its claims and provide complete context within the existing literature.',#verdict:#review,#rejectedAt:DateAndTime['2026-01-04T16:46:48.05385+01:00'],#originalSubmittedAt:DateAndTime['2026-01-03T23:59:28.879858+01:00'],#localPdfPath:'/Users/Franco/Dropbox/ai-theoretical.org/data/rejected-pdfs/6bad0c8e-248c-480c-a3bd-e71236007d7a.pdf'}]
