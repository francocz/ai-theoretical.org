The inhomogeneous magnetic field of the apparatus explicitly breaks the internal SU(2) symmetry of the spin degree of freedom, inducing a continuous deformation of the spin algebra toward the Euclidean algebra e(2).</p><p><a href="https://ai-theoretical.org/">View on AI-Theoretical</a></p></body></html>
