<section><h2>AI Editorial Assessment</h2><pre># EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT

## (A) STRUCTURED SUMMARY

1) Category: Research preprint (as declared by author).

2) Aims: To demonstrate that Italian progressive social media discourse implicitly deploys binding moral foundations (Loyalty, Authority, Sanctity) through secularized vocabulary, challenging MFT's liberal-conservative asymmetry claim at the level of actual language use rather than explicit endorsement.

3) Correctness: Minor local issues.

4) Coherence: Adequate.

5) Consistency: Consistent.

6) Semantic opacity: Low (Transparent).

7) Novelty: Original.

8) Bibliography: Adequate.

9) Effectiveness: Achieves aims.

10) Cross-framework traction: Medium.

11) Claims: Supported.

12) Contribution: Substantive.

13) Structure: Adequate.

14) Integrity: No issues.

15) Code: Not provided.

16) Editorial outcome: Suitable for inclusion as a research preprint.

17) Authors list: ["Franco Cazzaniga"]

## (B) EXTENDED ASSESSMENT

This paper presents an empirical challenge to Moral Foundations Theory's asymmetry thesis through computational analysis of Italian social media discourse. The central claim—that progressives implicitly deploy binding foundations while explicitly endorsing only individualizing ones—is supported by cross-platform data showing 85–90% of progressive posts contain binding-foundation markers. The methodological apparatus is transparent: custom lexicon construction is justified, potential circularity concerns are addressed through independent hashtag-based validation, and non-parametric statistics accommodate zero-inflated distributions. The theoretical contribution lies in the "secularized purity" concept, demonstrating structural parallelism in moral reasoning across ideological camps despite divergent vocabularies. Minor issues include the acknowledged Italian specificity and lexicon-based classification limitations, but these do not undermine the core findings. The paper explicitly delimits its scope, avoiding overreach while maintaining substantive theoretical implications. The cross-platform replication strengthens robustness claims. Bibliography coverage is adequate for the empirical scope, though deeper engagement with Italian political discourse scholarship could enrich contextualization. The work achieves its stated aims and offers original empirical evidence with clear implications for political psychology research. Suitable for inclusion as a research preprint.</pre></section>
