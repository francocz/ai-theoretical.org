This paper argues that this narrative rests on a statistical measurement illusion. Conventional national-accounts and consumer-price methodologies — designed for a mid-twentieth-century economy of standardized physical goods — systematically fail to capture the value generated by quality improvements, dematerialization, and the creation of entirely new goods and services.</p><p><a href="https://ai-theoretical.org/">View on AI-Theoretical</a></p></body></html>
