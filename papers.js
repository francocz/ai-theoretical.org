        abstract: `Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) posits that political conservatives rely on all five moral foundations (Care, Fairness, Loyalty, Authority, Sanctity), whereas progressives primarily endorse the individualizing foundations of Care and Fairness. This study examines whether this asymmetry characterizes actual moral language use in naturalistic political discourse. Analyzing 4,789 Italian-language social media posts from Mastodon (N = 2,812) and Reddit (N = 1,977), we investigate the implicit deployment of moral foundations in progressive discourse using a custom Italian lexicon and robust non-parametric statistics. Across both platforms, 85–90% of progressive-coded posts contain markers of binding foundations, with large within-group effect sizes (Cramér’s V = 0.71–0.80). Authority-related language appears significantly more frequently in progressive discourse on both platforms, while Sanctity-related contamination rhetoric shows consistent directional effects with small effect sizes. These findings suggest that the liberal–conservative asymmetry described by MFT reflects differences in explicit moral endorsement rather than underlying moral-cognitive structure. Progressive discourse systematically deploys binding moral foundations through a secularized vocabulary of authority and moral contamination, despite explicit commitments to individualizing foundations alone.`,

## (B) EXTENDED ASSESSMENT

This paper presents an empirical challenge to Moral Foundations Theory's asymmetry thesis through computational analysis of Italian social media discourse. The central claim—that progressives implicitly deploy binding foundations while explicitly endorsing only individualizing ones—is supported by cross-platform data showing 85–90% of progressive posts contain binding-foundation markers. The methodological apparatus is transparent: custom lexicon construction is justified, potential circularity concerns are addressed through independent hashtag-based validation, and non-parametric statistics accommodate zero-inflated distributions. The theoretical contribution lies in the "secularized purity" concept, demonstrating structural parallelism in moral reasoning across ideological camps despite divergent vocabularies. Minor issues include the acknowledged Italian specificity and lexicon-based classification limitations, but these do not undermine the core findings. The paper explicitly delimits its scope, avoiding overreach while maintaining substantive theoretical implications. The cross-platform replication strengthens robustness claims. Bibliography coverage is adequate for the empirical scope, though deeper engagement with Italian political discourse scholarship could enrich contextualization. The work achieves its stated aims and offers original empirical evidence with clear implications for political psychology research. Suitable for inclusion as a research preprint.`,
