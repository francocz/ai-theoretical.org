];ebras. The inhomogeneous magnetic field of the apparatus explicitly breaks the internal SU(2) symmetry of the spin degree of freedom, inducing a continuous deformation of the spin algebra toward the Euclidean algebra e(2). This contraction has three consequences: (i) the spherical coadjoint orbits of SU(2) degenerate into the cylindrical orbits of E(2), geometrically encoding the loss of transverse spin structure; (ii) finite-dimensional spin representations can contract only to one-dimensional characters of E(2), providing a representation-theoretic origin for discrete outcomes; (iii) the Husimi distribution of an arbitrary spin state concentrates onto the poles of the sphere, corresponding to the eigenstates of the spin projection along the field axis.
We derive the contraction rate from the physical parameters of the Stern–Gerlach apparatus and show that typical experimental conditions place the system deep in the contracted regime. The framework explains the discreteness of outcomes and the selection of the preferred measurement basis without invoking environmental decoherence or stochastic collapse models. It does not derive the Born rule, and whether it accounts for single-outcome realization depends on interpretive assumptions that are discussed explicitly. The approach suggests that explicit symmetry breaking may play a more general role in quantum measurement than previously recognized.`,

Correctness: No errors identified.
Coherence: Adequate.
Consistency: Consistent.
Novelty: Original.
Bibliography: Adequate.
Effectiveness: Achieves aims.
Cross-framework traction: High.
Editorial outcome: Suitable for inclusion as a preprint.

(B) EXTENDED ASSESSMENT
The manuscript develops a mathematically explicit framework in which the discreteness and basis selection of Stern–Gerlach outcomes are explained through an Inönü–Wigner contraction of su(2) to e(2), induced by the anisotropic measurement interaction. The argument is internally coherent and proceeds systematically from Lie-algebraic foundations through coadjoint-orbit geometry, representation theory, and Husimi-state analysis. The physical interpretation is carefully constrained: the framework explicitly does not claim to derive the Born rule or resolve the single-outcome problem, and these limits are stated without equivocation.

The mathematical constructions are standard but used in a non-routine way, and no formal inconsistencies or misstatements are evident. The paper maintains conceptual consistency between algebraic, geometric, and dynamical levels of description, avoiding conflation between internal symmetry space and physical space. Engagement with decoherence-based and interpretive literature is accurate and non-polemical, supporting cross-framework intelligibility rather than closure. Relative to its stated technical aims, the work is effective: it isolates and resolves the preferred-basis and discreteness components of the measurement problem within a clearly delimited theoretical scope. The manuscript meets the platform’s criteria for inclusion as a high-level theoretical preprint.`,

(B) EXTENDED ASSESSMENT
The paper provides a rigorous categorical construction of a stack of local stabilizer representations over a coadjoint orbit. By defining the stack R via the principal bundle p:G→O, the author demonstrates that the classical orbit method can be reformulated as an effective descent phenomenon. Technical correctness is maintained through the explicit verification of descent conditions for semisimple abelian categories and the lifting of the coadjoint action to a strict functorial action on the stack.
The work effectively bridges symplectic geometry and categorical representation theory by identifying rank-one global sections with prequantum line bundles. This identification allows for the recovery of irreducible representations via the Borel-Weil theorem, confirming that global representations are coherent shadows of local stabilizer symmetries. The bibliography is comprehensive, referencing foundational symplectic literature alongside modern categorical frameworks. Given the high cross-framework traction and successful achievement of its technical aims, the paper is suitable for inclusion as a preprint`,
