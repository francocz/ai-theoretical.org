This paper presents an original empirical study of human-AI collaborative software development using the Model Context Protocol to enable direct AI manipulation of a Pharo Smalltalk image. The work demonstrates a novel development paradigm where the AI operates as primary implementer while the human functions as specifier and acceptance tester. The technical documentation is thorough, providing concrete metrics and architectural details. The analysis of pair programming dynamics offers substantive theoretical insights about cognitive division of labor in human-AI collaboration. The bibliography adequately covers the immediate technical dependencies (MCP, Pharo, pair programming literature) without attempting encyclopedic coverage. The paper's transparency about limitations and the unusual co-authorship arrangement enhances its integrity. The working system and available source code provide empirical grounding for the theoretical claims about this development approach.`,

];rred measurement basis without invoking environmental decoherence or stochastic collapse models. It does not derive the Born rule, and whether it accounts for single-outcome realization depends on interpretive assumptions that are discussed explicitly. The approach suggests that explicit symmetry breaking may play a more general role in quantum measurement than previously recognized.`,

Category: Research preprint
Aims: To provide a technical and conceptual account of spin measurement in the Stern–Gerlach experiment by modeling wave function collapse as a symmetry-breaking Inönü–Wigner contraction of the su(2) algebra.

Consistency: Consistent.

(B) EXTENDED ASSESSMENT
The manuscript develops a mathematically explicit framework in which the discreteness and basis selection of Stern–Gerlach outcomes are explained through an Inönü–Wigner contraction of su(2) to e(2), induced by the anisotropic measurement interaction. The argument is internally coherent and proceeds systematically from Lie-algebraic foundations through coadjoint-orbit geometry, representation theory, and Husimi-state analysis. The physical interpretation is carefully constrained: the framework explicitly does not claim to derive the Born rule or resolve the single-outcome problem, and these limits are stated without equivocation.

The mathematical constructions are standard but used in a non-routine way, and no formal inconsistencies or misstatements are evident. The paper maintains conceptual consistency between algebraic, geometric, and dynamical levels of description, avoiding conflation between internal symmetry space and physical space. Engagement with decoherence-based and interpretive literature is accurate and non-polemical, supporting cross-framework intelligibility rather than closure. Relative to its stated technical aims, the work is effective: it isolates and resolves the preferred-basis and discreteness components of the measurement problem within a clearly delimited theoretical scope. The manuscript meets the platform’s criteria for inclusion as a high-level theoretical preprint.`,

(B) EXTENDED ASSESSMENT
The paper provides a rigorous categorical construction of a stack of local stabilizer representations over a coadjoint orbit. By defining the stack R via the principal bundle p:G→O, the author demonstrates that the classical orbit method can be reformulated as an effective descent phenomenon. Technical correctness is maintained through the explicit verification of descent conditions for semisimple abelian categories and the lifting of the coadjoint action to a strict functorial action on the stack.
The work effectively bridges symplectic geometry and categorical representation theory by identifying rank-one global sections with prequantum line bundles. This identification allows for the recovery of irreducible representations via the Borel-Weil theorem, confirming that global representations are coherent shadows of local stabilizer symmetries. The bibliography is comprehensive, referencing foundational symplectic literature alongside modern categorical frameworks. Given the high cross-framework traction and successful achievement of its technical aims, the paper is suitable for inclusion as a preprint`,
