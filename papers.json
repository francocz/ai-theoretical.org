    "abstract": "This paper traces the genealogy of the dualism between intelligible and sensible, between \emph{logos} and matter, from its pre-Socratic background through its Platonic inauguration to its modern transformations. The central thesis is that Plato introduced a structural division that subsequent philosophy inherited, criticized superficially, re-articulated, but rarely questioned as a framework. The paper examines how this dualism was first epistemic and social (Plato's distinction between philosophical knowledge and common experience), then cosmological (the scientific revolution's separation between the mathematically describable real and the qualitatively perceived apparent), and finally metaphysical (Descartes' res cogitans and res extensa). The natural philosophers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries---Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Newton---are treated here as what they were: philosophers investigating nature, whose work deepened and transformed the Platonic distance between the true and the accessible. The aim is not to refute dualism but to make it visible as a historical structure, a framework that has become so assimilated as to be invisible."
