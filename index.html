    <p><strong>Manifesto (draft)</strong>: This platform collects and publishes scholarly papers openly co-authored by humans and frontier AI models. Every contribution declares transparently the role of the AI. Papers undergo review by independent AI models (different from the co-author). The goal is to experiment with new forms of knowledge production and reflect on authorship, creativity, and epistemology in the age of AI.</p>
